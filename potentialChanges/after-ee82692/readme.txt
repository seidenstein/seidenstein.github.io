I tried to add functionality to combine the load file and load session buttons.
This seemed to work, but there were issues with the session files getting corrupted.
This is the message I left in the chat in Cursor.org:

It seems like when I randomly alternate between loading a new database file and restoring a .yrslv sometimes duplicate cards for the tables appear in addition to the correct cards (the correct cards appear before the duplicate cards. The duplicate cards don't show any data other than the table names, the font controls and the show structure/show rows buttons. However, these controls in the duplicate cards wind up controlling the correct cards. (The font controls and buttons for structure/rows in the correct cards work correctly to affect the card that the button is in. The duplicate cards are not affected by clicking the buttons in the correct cards).
